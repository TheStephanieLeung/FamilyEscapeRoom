This is an educational game designed to showcase family income struggles across different social classes. Players will experience three scenarios:

1. Upper Class: Pay bills easily using a credit card.
2. Middle Class: Find a checkbook, check balance, and manage finances.
3. Lower Income: Struggle to make ends meet, possibly seeking loans or scrounging for change.

This project is built using React and Phaser.
